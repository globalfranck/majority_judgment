# Majority judgment
Coding a majority judgment algorithm to simulate an democratic election

## What's the majority judgment ? 
It's a voting system in which the candidate who gets the highest median rating is elected

## How does it works ?
Electors vote for each candidates and rate them on a scale from Excellent to Reject

The scale contains 6 scales : 
>> Excellent (Excellent = E),  
>> Very Good (TrÃ¨s Bien = TB),   
>> Good (Bien = B),   
>> Acceptable (Passable = P),   
>> Poor (Insuffisant= I),  
>> Reject (A rejeter = R)  

The winner is the candidate with the highest median grade
